# Weather_app
 In this project, we will build an app that will find the deviceâ€™s location coordinates(longitude and latitude). Then we will send this data to the API via an API key(which we will see later). The API will send us a JSON from which we will extract the required data that is the temperature and city of the location.
 # overview
  In this project, we will be building a weather application. This application will show the temperature of a location. To fetch weather information we will need an API. An API(Application Programming Interface) is a function that allows applications to interact and share data using various components and microservices. For this project, we will be using WeatherBit API for fetching weather data. WeatherBit API provides a fast and elegant way to fetch weather data. Note that we are going to implement this project using the Kotlin language. 
# API
 To get the API key simply sign-in on WeatherBit and subscribe for a free API of Current Weather Data API. After doing so you will receive an API key and you are good to go.
